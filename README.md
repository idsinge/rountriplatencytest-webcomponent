# @hi-audio/latency-test web component

A Web Component for measuring browser round-trip audio latency in Web Audio applications.

## Status

> **Work in progress.** The `@hi-audio/latency-test` package is not yet published. The API described below is the intended design. The current codebase contains a working prototype (`npm run dev`) and the full package planning is underway.

## What it does

<img src="./assets/MLS_Test.png" alt="MLS round-trip latency measurement diagram" width="700"/>

- Measures round-trip browser audio latency using an [MLS (Maximum Length Sequence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence) signal and cross-correlation
- Designed for integration into Web Audio and DAW-like web applications
- Headless-first API: `start()` / `stop()` methods and custom events — no built-in UI
- Reports latency in milliseconds and a reliability ratio in dB (values above `18 dB` indicate a trustworthy measurement)

## Planned usage (draft)

```html
<latency-test id="lt"></latency-test>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('lt').start()">Test</button>

<script type="module">
  import '@hi-audio/latency-test'

  document.getElementById('lt').addEventListener('latency-result', (e) => {
    console.log(e.detail.latency, 'ms — ratio:', e.detail.ratio, 'dB')
  })
</script>
```

Multiple consecutive tests with aggregate statistics:

```html
<latency-test id="lt" number-of-tests="5"></latency-test>

<script type="module">
  import '@hi-audio/latency-test'

  const lt = document.getElementById('lt')

  lt.addEventListener('latency-result', (e) => {
    console.log('run:', e.detail.latency, 'ms')
  })

  lt.addEventListener('latency-complete', (e) => {
    const { mean, std, min, max } = e.detail
    console.log(`mean ${mean.toFixed(2)} ms · std ${std.toFixed(2)} · min ${min.toFixed(2)} · max ${max.toFixed(2)}`)
  })

  lt.start()
</script>
```

## Documentation

Full integration docs are published via VitePress (see `docs/`):

- **API reference** — attributes, methods, events, algorithm constants: `docs/api.md`
- **Framework examples** — Vanilla JS, React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js: `docs/examples/`
- **Installation** — npm, CDN, AudioContext sharing: `docs/install.md`
- Live demo: coming soon

## Local development

Run the prototype app:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:1234
```

Run the documentation site:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Other commands:

```bash
npm run build         # production build (demo app)
npm run docs:build    # build VitePress docs
npm run docs:preview  # preview built docs locally
```

**Requirement:** Node.js v14 or above.

## Repository scope

This repository contains the prototype implementation, full package planning (see `CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`), and the VitePress documentation site. The root README is intentionally concise — detailed integration guidance lives in `docs/`. 

## Roadmap

- [x] Prototype: MLS signal generation, cross-correlation via Web Worker, MediaRecorder capture
- [ ] Web Component refactor: `<latency-test>` Custom Element, Shadow DOM, instance-based architecture
- [ ] AudioWorklet backend: dual-channel raw PCM capture (mic + reference loopback) replacing MediaRecorder
- [ ] npm package publication as `@hi-audio/latency-test`
- [ ] Additional signal types: chirp (logarithmic sine sweep), Golay complementary sequences

## Research origin

This project originates from research on browser round-trip audio latency presented at [WAC 2025](https://wac-2025.ircam.fr/). The original proof-of-concept app remains available at [gilpanal/weblatencytest](https://github.com/gilpanal/weblatencytest). This repository is the Web Component development branch. The same measurement method is also used in the [Hi-Audio online platform](https://hiaudio.fr).
